# Public Images Folder

This folder contains static images that are served directly by Next.js.

## Required Images

- `background.png` - Background image for the page
- `glowCircle.png` - Glowing circle image for the shader component

## Usage

Images in this folder are accessible via URLs starting with `/images/`:

- `/images/background.png`
- `/images/glowCircle.png`

## Important

Make sure to move your PNG files from the root `images/` folder to this `public/images/` folder for them to work properly with Next.js.
